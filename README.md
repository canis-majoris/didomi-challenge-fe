A small React SPA for collecting and listing user consents. It provides a validated form to submit consents and a paginated list to review them, backed by a mock data layer with React Query caching, accessible UI components, and strict TypeScript.

## Features

- Give consent form with validation (name, email, consent type)
- Persisted in-memory mock API (no network calls)
- Paginated consent list (client-side, via mock API abstraction)
- React Query caching & invalidation
- Accessible, keyboard-friendly UI
- Strict TypeScript & ESLint rules
